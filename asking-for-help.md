# Asking For Help

## Open Office Hours

Instructors will be holding open office hours on each project day.
Take a look at the [class calendar](https://git.generalassemb.ly/pages/DC-WDI/WDI18/#2017-07-27) for specific dates and times. The normal afternoon and evening office hour schedule will **not** be observed during project week.

## Github Issues

We strongly encourage you, however, to file a Github issue prior to asking the instructors for help directly.
This will not only make you a better developer but a better learner.
Visit [this readme](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi16/blob/master/asking-for-help.md) for more details.
